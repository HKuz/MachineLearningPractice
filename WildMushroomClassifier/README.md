# Machine Learning Practice: Wild Mushroom Classification

Machine Learning project for EDS to classify wild mushrooms as toxic or not. This is a 'take home' challenge from EDS to practice ML workflow and techniques on a small-sized, relatively clean dataset.

The goal of this exercise was to practice resampling techniques, since the dataset exhibited imbalanced classes within the target variable. It also didn't have a win condition, necessitating the application of various performance metrics to evaluate the models.
